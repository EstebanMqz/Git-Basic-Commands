# Git Commands and Contributions

## Fork vs Clone:  

-	**Fork**: Merge with original repo is possible with a pull request.

-	**Clone**: Merge with original repo is only achieved by pushing to fork and then a pull request.

### Contributions without permissions:

*Note:* It is better to fork a repository before cloning it due to [copyrights](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) when the *user is NOT declared as contributor*.

<br />

General steps for this type of contributions are the following:
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) repository.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) forked repository.
3. Make Changes in Local.
4. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) to Personal Remote.
5. [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) to Original Remote.

### Contributions with permissions:

General steps:
1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Make Changes in Local.
